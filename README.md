# Wireframing

## Introduction  
Wireframing is the process of creating a **visual blueprint** for a digital product, such as a website or mobile application.  
It focuses on **layout, structure, and functionality** rather than visual design details like colors and typography.  

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders **visualize the user interface (UI)** early in the design process.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process  

- **Clarity of Ideas:**  
  Wireframes help translate abstract concepts into concrete visual representations.

- **Early Feedback:**  
  They allow stakeholders to review and suggest changes before investing in full-scale design and development.

- **Improved Collaboration:**  
  Wireframes serve as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients.

- **Cost and Time Efficiency:**  
  Making changes to wireframes is far easier and cheaper than modifying final designs or code.
